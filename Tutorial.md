#Iceland in QGIS: A Supplemental Tutorial on Adding Layers

##This tutorial is designed so you can practice the skills you used in the [Programming Historian QGIS Tutorial](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/qgis-layers) about adding layers.

---------

1. Make a folder or directory called "Iceland" on your computer.

2. Download the follwoing data sets from DIVA-GIS [Google "DIVA-GIS Countries"] into that directory and **unzip each downloaded folder** into the Iceland directory.
* Administrative Areas: ISL_adm.zip
* Roads: ISL_rds.zip

3. Open QGIS and set up a new project.

4. Set up CRS (Coordinate Reference System) so that the project is using the **ISN93/Lambert 1993** Projected Coordinate System. 
* Go to **Project** in the menu bar
* Select **Project Properties** from the drop-down menu
* Select **CRS** from the side bar of the new window

5. Build a base map: Open the following vectors, then change the way they look using **Properties** (either double click on the layer or right-click and select **Properties**. Under **Style** click on **Simple Fill**, go to **Colors**, **Fill**, **Transparent Fill**.
* ISL_adm0.shp; change so there is no color fill
     * Under **Style** click on **Simple Fill** 
     * go to **Colors**
     * Select **Fill**
     * Select **Transparent Fill**
* ISL-adm1.shp; same as above
* ISL_roads.shp; go to **Style** to change the color and width of the lines so they are easier to see

6. Look at the attribute table of ISL_adm1.shp. These show the country's 8 Regions. Note that table **Name_1** gives the name of the Region. Write down the name of that column and close the attribute table. 
* Go into the **Properties** for ISL_adm.shp
* Select **Labels** from the side menu
* Select **Show Labels for this layer** from the drop-down menu
* Open next drop-down menu **Label with** and select the name of your column
* Increase the size of your font till it is clearly visible on the map

7. Go to Blackboard and from the Iceland tutorial area, download the file named Iceland_1849.zip. Unzip it and import the .tif file into QGIS as a raster file. Note: I have already geo-referenced this file.

8. In the **Layers Panel** drag the Iceland_1849 raaster layer to the bottom of the list so the Region and Names are superimposed on the map.

9. Go back to ISL_adm0.shp and ISL_adm1.shp and change the width of the lines so they are visible.

10. Unselect **Iceland_1849** in the **Layers Panel**

11. Go back to Blackboard and download the file named Iceland_1697.zip and **repeat steps 7 and 8.**

12. Observe the difference in cartographic accuracy between the 1697 and 1849 maps by toggling between the two layers in the **Layers Panel**

13. **Save Your Work** and close QGIS- your done!
